# DataScience-Class-Projects

**UPDATE:** my performance across these projects and in the final project earned me an offer to **TA Datasci 112** for the next academic term (April 2024- June 2024). This means that next quarter, I will teach the content of the course to students who take this class.

These are projects I have completed in datasci 112, which I took at Stanford in Winter 2024.

In lab 2a and 2b, I used **data-cleaning and visualization techniques** to represent data from a TV show. In lab 3a and 3b, I used text-processing and k-neighbors regression techniques to visualize trends in the data. In lab 4a and 4b, I fit and tuned **machine learning models to make predictions** based on a mix of quantitative, categorical, and textual data. In lab 5a and 5b, I utilized web scraping and unigram and bigram algorithms to produce **generative AI models**.

I have uploaded a final project which uses techniques including **machine learning and web scraping**. Read about it in the ABOUT FINAL PROJECT file and Data sci poster PDF file.
