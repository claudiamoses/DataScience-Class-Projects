The assignment for my final project in Datasci 112 was to create an original project using data collection and processing techniques I learned in class. 
My partner and I decided to scrape government websites for textual data about bills introduced to the 117th U.S. Congress and use the data to try and predict which bills would become law.
The details of the final conclusions can be found in the file DATASCI poster template.pdf
