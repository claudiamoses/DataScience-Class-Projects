        "Build a Markov chain using the data that you read in above. Your model will process the lyrics and store the word transitions for that artist. The transitions will be stored in a dict called `chain`, which maps each word to a list of \"next\" words.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if your song was [\"The Joker\" by the Steve Miller Band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dV3AziKTBUo), `chain` might look as follows:\n",

        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",

You should have `\"<START>\"` and `\"<END>\"` states so that we can keep track of which words are likely to begin and end songs. You should also include a state called `\"<N>\"` to denote line breaks so that you can keep track of where lines begin and end. It is up to you whether you want to include normalize case and strip punctuation.\n",

        "The bigram chain model generated a song that was much more sensical than did the unigram chain. This is because the word that was chosen to be added onto the list was based on a little more context because it had to logically follow two words in order rather than just one, so it was created from a larger part of a sentence that already made sense. One thing that we talked about in class was that these algorithms cause an overall lack of context when generating new outputs, and I definitely see that here.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the issue with the bigram chain is that it is much larger than the unigram chain. So although we got a fairly more sensical song, if we wanted to get more sensical, we would have to make even bigger bigram chains which could be more computationally and spacially expensive. So the advantage of the unigram chain is that it's a smaller chain/smaller computation, but the bigram makes a marginally better song.\n",
