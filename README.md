# DataScience-Class-Projects
These are projects I have completed in datasci 112, which I took at Stanford in Winter 2024.

In lab 2a and 2b, I used **data-cleaning and visualization techniques** to represent data from a TV show. In lab 3a and 3b, I used text-processing and k-neighbors regression techniques to visualize trends in the data. In lab 4a and 4b, I fit and tuned **machine learning models to make predictions** based on a mix of quantitative, categorical, and textual data. In lab 5a and 5b, I utilized web scraping and unigram and bigram algorithms to produce **generative AI models**.

Toward the end of March, I expect to upload a final project using techniques including **machine learning and web scraping**.
