# DataScience-Class-Projects

**UPDATE:** my performance across these projects and in the final project earned me an offer to **TA Datasci 112** for the next academic term (April 2024- June 2024). This means that next quarter, I will teach the content of the course to students who take this class. Please see my [**updated resume**](https://github.com/claudiamoses/DataScience-Class-Projects/blob/038e8cada85544d92536fd1826ef487e6066f71a/1RESUME.pdf) for the most up-to-date information about my experiences.

Thank you for visiting my page! These are projects I have completed in datasci 112, which I took at Stanford in Winter 2024.

In lab [3a](https://github.com/claudiamoses/DataScience-Class-Projects/blob/5ca645882bffdda4047a8ab4677110df7ed02f4b/Lab_3A.ipynb) and [3b](https://github.com/claudiamoses/DataScience-Class-Projects/blob/5cf7fc2a50e5370888f6c35f61ca869c84d85c0d/Lab_3B.ipynb), I used **text-processing and regression techniques** to **visualize trends** in the data. In lab [4a](https://github.com/claudiamoses/DataScience-Class-Projects/blob/28fefddd6bceb823ecd79d1d3a8a59fc65058d2c/Lab_4A.ipynb) and [4b](https://github.com/claudiamoses/DataScience-Class-Projects/blob/ac778cefeb5b01fb6b327ef92ea0d7a684b4bb44/Lab_4B.ipynb), I fit and tuned **machine learning models to make predictions** based on a mix of quantitative, categorical, and textual data. In lab [5a](https://github.com/claudiamoses/DataScience-Class-Projects/blob/a7529c0026a8d7b905c53c9765a07ea475425830/Lab_5A.ipynb) and [5b](https://github.com/claudiamoses/DataScience-Class-Projects/blob/009fc3141b448db67f74e53cc40322b5c9166049/Lab_5B.ipynb), I utilized web scraping and unigram and bigram algorithms to produce **generative AI models**.

I have uploaded a final project which uses techniques including **machine learning and web scraping**. Read about it in the ABOUT FINAL PROJECT file and Data sci poster PDF file.
