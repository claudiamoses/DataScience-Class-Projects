# DataScience-Class-Projects
These are projects I have completed in datasci 112, which I took at Stanford in Winter 2024.

In lab 3a and 3b, I used text-processing and k-neighbors regression techniques to visualize trends in the data. In lab 4a and 4b, I fit and tuned machine learning models to make predictions based on a mix of quantitative, categorical, and textual data.

At the end of March, I expect to upload a final project using techniques including machine learning and web scraping.
